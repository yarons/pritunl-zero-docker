# Pritunl-Zero-Docker
Dockerfile and docker-compose for Pritunl-Zero

Please notice there are numerous Pritunl-Zero Docker implementations around, the special thing about this implementation is the fact that it can run on different architectures other than x86.
I'm still missing a docker-entrypoint.

This is a licensed software, you'll have to buy a license to fully unlock its features, this implementation is unlicensed.
